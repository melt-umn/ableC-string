String extension
================

This extension provides a wrapper around char* strings, providing a number of useful operators.  
The purpose of this extension is to provide a simple demo of operator overloading.  

Operators include
* String append: s1 + s2
* String repeat: s * i
* String equality: s1 == s2
* String index: s[i]
* String conversion operator: str(x)
* String representation operator: show(x)
